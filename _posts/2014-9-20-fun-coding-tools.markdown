I've discovered some really awesome tools in class to make development a little easier. It's amazing how much more quickly I pick these things up when someone tells me directly rather than me scouring the internet for info. Here's my list thus far:
<h2 class="learn-title">'H' shortcut</h2>
<div class="learn-list">This is in chrome inspector tools. This shortcut removes the element of the page you have selected. I don't have to do this very often but I do love me some shortcuts.
</div>
<h2 class="learn-title">Can I Use?</h2>
<div class="learn-list">I wish I'd known about this website forever-ago. <a href="http://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">Can I Use</a> is a site that lists browser compatibility for css, html, and javascript.
</div>
<h2 class="learn-title">Shortcuts in Sublime Text (and other editers)</h2>
<div class="learn-list">cmd-d: to select multiple elements of same type in document. cmd-/ to comment out or uncomment code
</div>
