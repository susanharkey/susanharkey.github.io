Last week we learned how to set up a git account, create a git repository, copy it to our local computer, and add, commit, and push files to the repository. It was all new to me, and I am trying to figure out how to implement git in my wordpress workflow.

I also learned a couple of new html and css things. Although I've used inline-block before, I didn't really know the purpose of it (to give inline elements a width and height). It was awesome to get an html refresher since I've been working in Wordpress. I am happy to know of boilerplate. Part of the reason I enrolled in the course was to get to know a more efficient workflow. Another awesome tool I learned about was the Can I Use website, which lists all the browser settings for css.
