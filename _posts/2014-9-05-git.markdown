Last week we learned how to set up a git account, create a git repository, copy it to our local computer, and add, commit, and push files to the repository. It was all new to me, and I am trying to figure out how to implement git in my wordpress workflow. I found <a href="http://ameliabriscoe.com/configure-wordpress-git-repository/this tutorial" target="_blank">this tutorial by Amelia Briscoe</a> about using a git reqository on bitbucket, which she recommended over github because you can get free private repositories. I guess you don't want sensitive info from your wordpress install to be public.
