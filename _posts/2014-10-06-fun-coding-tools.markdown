I've discovered some really awesome tools in class to make development a little easier. It's amazing how much more quickly I pick these things up when someone tells me directly rather than me scouring the internet for info. Here's my list thus far:
<ul>
	<li><b>'H' shortcut</b> in chrome inspector tools. This shortcut removes the element of the page you have selected. I don't have to do this very often but I do love me some shortcuts.</li>
	<li><b>Can I Use?</b>I wish I'd known about this website forever-ago. <a href="http://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">Can I Use</a> is a site that lists browser compatibility for css, html, and javascript.</li>

	<li></li>
</ul>

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
